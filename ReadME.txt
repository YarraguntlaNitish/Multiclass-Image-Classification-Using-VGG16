This is an Example of multi class classification using pretrained VGG16 model

In this example we have a dataset of three categories of Pokemon's which we use for classification.

In the training set we have a total of 445 images belonging to the 3 classes and

in the test set we have 238 images belonging to the 3 classes.

We will train our model VGG16 using the weights that are downloaded from Imagenet during the model generation.

##VGG16 model for Keras

This is the Keras model of the 16-layer network used by the VGG team in the ILSVRC-2014 competition.
